#__Introduction__
This repository contains R, Python and Bash code that comprise workflows used in chapters 1 and 2 of my dissertation. These chapters have been published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51018-0) and [Virus Evolution](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/11/1/veae116/7934600), and the abstracts are included below. The complete worksflows are complicated, but typical phylogenetics/phylodynamics workflows that involve accessing sequences using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, processing them using various Bayesian and maximum likelihood tools, and summarising and reporting the results.
